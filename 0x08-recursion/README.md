## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

What is recursion

How to implement recursion

In what situations you should implement recursion

In what situations you shouldn’t implement recursion

## Requirements

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

All your files should end with a new line

A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory

Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

You are not allowed to use global variables

No more than 5 functions per file

You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden

You are allowed to use _putchar

You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account

In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples

The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h

Don’t forget to push your header file

You are not allowed to use any kind of loops

You are not allowed to use static variables

## Tasks

Task 0. She locked away a secret, deep inside herself, something she once knew to be true... but chose to forget: Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line.

Task 1. Why is it so important to dream? Because, in my dreams we are together: Write a function that prints a string in reverse.

Task 2. Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange: Write a function that returns the length of a string.


Task 3. You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling: Write a function that returns the factorial of a given number.

Task 4. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate: Write a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.

Task 5. Your subconscious is looking for the dreamer: Write a function that returns the natural square root of a number.

Task 6. Inception. Is it possible?: Write a function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0

Task 7. They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential. Now that's when we're awake. When we're asleep, we can do almost anything: Write a function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not.

Task 8. Inception. Now, before you bother telling me it's impossible...: Write a function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return 0.
